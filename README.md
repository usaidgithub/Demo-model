# Demo-model
This repository contains the demo model for predicting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) as part of the project developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024. Our goal is to build an early warning system that identifies the potential risk of GLOFs by analyzing satellite data and other critical environmental factors.

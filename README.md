GLOF Forecast Demonstration Model Welcome to the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) Forecast Demonstration Model, a project under Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024. This project uses satellite data and machine learning to gain consensus on flood probability. To mitigate this threat, we are developing a system that will analyze environmental and satellite data to predict such events before they occur. This demonstration shows the first run of the model using real satellite data. Since the file is too large to upload directly to GitHub, we are providing the link for you to download the file yourself.

ATL03_20240731235234_06802403_006_01.h5 This file contains the satellite data needed to train the prediction model. The rules in this repository will guide you through the processing of your data. It has all the rules needed to preprocess the data, train the model, and measure the results. Note: Due to the size of the .csv files, we have not included them in this repository yet. However, the jupyter notebook includes the steps to extract the necessary data from the .h5 file and create your own .csv file. Probability Model: We use a random forest distribution to predict whether the GLOF will occur. Classification: The model predicts whether the GLOF will occur (1) or not occur (0). Metrics: Measure the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to fully understand its ability to process predictions.
